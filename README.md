# Phuong (Charles) Vu's Photo Gallery

Welcome to my personal photo gallery website project. This project involves creating a website to showcase photos that I have been taken over the last few year. During this project, I utilized HTML, SCSS, and CSS to create the layout, design, and styles of the website. Then, I used Javascript to implement users' interaction with the website.
